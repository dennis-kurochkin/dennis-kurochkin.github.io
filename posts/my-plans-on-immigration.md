I was shocked when I first found out about the war. I couldn't believe that it actually happened, it was like a fever dream. But reality finally kicks in with me. I understand, that time has come a long time ago and if I wait a little longer, I might never have the chance. And the nerve.

So from now on I'm gonna be posting occasionally about what I do to get what I want. Maybe this blog will be my semi-private guide for myself, or just a journal of my failures and successes.

If you are reading this, I'm surprised.
